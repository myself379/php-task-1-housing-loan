The monthly repayment of a bank housing loan of fixed interest rate is calculated using the simple amortization schedule formula.
 
Where:
	A is periodic amortization payment
	P is the principal amount borrowed
	r is the percentage rate per period divided by 100
	n is the number of payments

For example, a customer securing a loan of 90% of property value of RM 500,000, with fixed interest rate of 4.45% per annum, over a period of 30 years, the monthly repayment would be
= (0.90*500000) * ((0.0445/12) * (1+(0.0445/12)) ^ (30*12)) / ((1+(0.0445/12)) ^ (30*12)) - 1)
= 2266.73
The monthly repayment is RM 2,263.73.

Task 1 (Basic):
What is the monthly repayment if the customer applying for a loan of 90% of property value of RM 500,000, with fixed interest rate of 4.65% per annum, over a period of 30 years?


Task 1 (Advance):
In continuation of the above scenario, if the customer is able to pay monthly installment of RM 2,000 (or less) per month, what is the loan period (in years) to achieve this goal, granted all other variables remained the same?

If the loan period exceeds 35 year, then the loan will not be approved by the bank. If this happens, the customer may opt to borrow less. What is the loan amount to borrow so that the customer can repay the monthly installment of RM 2,000 (with the same interest rate and loan period of 30 years)?
